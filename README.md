This is a SAMP client emulator, made for multithreading, with RPC systems and so on, the project is not finished, those who have steady hands will finish it. In RakBot.cpp there is an example of how to use it, in CNetGame.cpp there is an explanation of what and how it works.

Many thanks for the help https://github.com/cizaquita/FakeSAMP
